    <h3 class="brown h_header">About Kefei Wang</h3>
    <div class="black h_content">
      <p>It has been eighteen years since Kefei Wang passed away, and her body is still lying
inside a mortuary. Although her family has appealed to various levels of authorities for
the release of the body, they have never been successful. Since then, they have been
relentless in claiming the remains.</p>
<p>
Even simple requests to visit her body have been denied. In lieu of an actual visit,
authorities have tried to convince the family to instead sign an agreement to have her
body cremated, which would supposedly serve to destroy any evidence of torture. All
families whose family members have been persecuted to death face similar issues.
She was just 34 years old when she passed away. People who knew her shed tears
over this act of injustice and persecution.</p>

        <p>Kefei Wang in China, 1999</p>
      </div>
<p>
Kefei was born in Changchun and into a family of intellectuals. All her siblings were
well-educated and disciplined under her parents’ strict upbringing. So Kefei stood out
from other girls by her kind heart, beautiful look, attractive demeanor and vibrant
personality.</p>
<p>
When Falun Dafa spread to her hometown, most of her family members started to
practice. Immediately, Kefei found her true self. While the world was losing its moral
root, she instead found value and direction in her life via Dafa. As a practitioner, she
followed the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance. She always put
others’ needs before herself. She used to work at a bank for ten years and received the
best reviews at work. She had become a better and better person.
</p>
<p>
In 1999, the Chinese Communist Party started to persecute Falun Gong. Kefei wanted
to continue her practice in peace, so she went to Beijing several times to clarify the truth
to authorities. Falun Dafa guides people to follow the principles of Truth, Compassion
and Tolerance, and it has helped thousands and thousands of practitioners stay healthy,
so why would the government persecute Falun Dafa?
</p>
<p>
Because of these truth clarification activities, Kefei was arrested and thrown into prison.
Her older brother, Liansu Wang, has also undergone inhumane tortures, and her sister,
Yifei Wang, was also detained. This is only the tip of the iceberg, however, as
thousands of these cases still happen in China today.
</p>
<p>
Various other tactics have been implemented. In 2019, they had Fox broadcast a short
documentary on TV, which has drawn public attention to the persecution.
Kefei’s family started a “Free Sister’s Body” campaign, the mission of which is very
simple: to claim the body and start an investigation into her death, and to have her body
buried. They need help to complete this mission.
